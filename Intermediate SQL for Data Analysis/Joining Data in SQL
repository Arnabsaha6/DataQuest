1.Introducing Joins
SELECT * FROM facts
INNER JOIN cities ON cities.facts_id = facts.id
LIMIT 10;
2.Understanding Inner Joins
SELECT c.*, f.name country_name FROM facts f
INNER JOIN cities c ON c.facts_id = f.id
LIMIT 5;
3.Practicing Inner Joins
SELECT f.name country, c.name capital_city FROM cities c
INNER JOIN facts f ON f.id = c.facts_id
WHERE c.capital = 1
4.Left Joins
SELECT f.name country, f.population
FROM facts f
LEFT JOIN cities c ON c.facts_id = f.id
WHERE c.name IS NULL;
5.Right Joins and Outer Joins
6.Finding the Most Populous Capital Cities
SELECT c.name capital_city, f.name country, c.population
FROM facts f
INNER JOIN cities c ON c.facts_id = f.id
WHERE c.capital = 1
ORDER BY 3 DESC
LIMIT 10;
